# StockPrediction

A simple stock price prediction project that trains and evaluates machine learning models on historical market data to forecast future prices.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for time-series stock data
- Model training, validation, and evaluation pipelines
- Scripts for inference / generating predictions
- Configuration-driven experiments

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Recommended: virtual environment (venv or conda)
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (e.g. pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow/torch)

## Quick start
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    - python -m venv .venv
    - source .venv/bin/activate  (Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate)
2. Install dependencies:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Prepare data:
    - Place your CSV(s) under `data/` or update config to point to your dataset.
    - Expected format: date, open, high, low, close, volume (or a README in `data/` with specifics).
4. Train a model:
    - python scripts/train.py --config configs/default.yaml
5. Run inference:
    - python scripts/predict.py --model outputs/best_model.pth --input data/sample.csv

## Directory structure (recommended)
- data/                 - raw and processed datasets
- notebooks/            - exploratory analysis and experiments
- scripts/              - train.py, predict.py, evaluate.py
- models/               - model definitions
- outputs/              - checkpoints, logs, predictions
- configs/              - experiment configuration files
- README.md

## Usage notes
- Use configuration files for reproducibility (seed, window size, features).
- Log metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE) and sample predictions for validation.
- Keep test data strictly separate from training/validation splits.

## Contributing
- Create an issue for bugs or feature requests.
- Fork, add tests, and submit a pull request with a clear description.
